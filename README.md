# Node Demo Exercise

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

## Demo
Incase if you dont have time to setup project locally, I have also setup a running [Demo](http://freeseosolutions.com/nod-demo/) which you can test and see the working example.
 

## Installation
To run app locally it requires following tools to be installed.
* [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
* [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

After setting up environment clone repo from github [https://github.com/kamrankhatti/nod-demo.git](https://github.com/kamrankhatti/nod-demo.git) and go inside nod-demo project folder and run `yarn install` to install all packages and dependecies.
## Development server

Run `yarn start --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

`home/components/form/form.component.spec.ts` file contains complete form validation tests, give a chance to look into it.

## Further help

PS. Since this project didn't communicate with APIs hence state management didn't implemented.
I have an other interview demo in which I worked on back-end API integration and implemented state management.

You can find code example [here](https://github.com/kamrankhatti/tz-demo) and view `store` folder inside `src/app` and its usage inside `home/home.component.ts` just a heads up though you might interested how state management works.

If you need any sort of help to configure/setup project or any other technical issue feel free to ping me at kamrankhatti@yahoo.com
